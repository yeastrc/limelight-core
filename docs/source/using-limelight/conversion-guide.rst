How to Convert Your Data to Limelight XML
=========================================

Limelight is designed to support data generated by any mass spec data processing pipeline. To accomplish
this, we have designed a file format called Limelight XML that implements an XML schema that stores the data
that Limelight needs in the most generalized way possible. Data that are uploaded to Limelight need to be
formatted as Limelight XML. And, importantly, any data represented as Limelight XML can be uploaded to Limelight--regardless
of the software pipeline that generated the data.

What are Converters
===================
Converters are programs that convert the native output of software pipelines to Limelight XML that can be
imported into Limelight.

This design moves the job of reading the output of different software pipelines to smaller individual
programs we call converters. Each of these programs can be maintained individually, separate from Limelight--ensuring
they stay current. And adding support for a new search pipeline becomes the relatively simple matter of
writing a converter for the output of that program.

How to Get Converters
===========================
We have written a number of converters for popular mass spec processing pipelines. Follow the links below
to the GitHub repository for the individual converter for information on how to run that converter.

How to Run Converters
=====================
Each of the above converters has a link to the specific converter's GitHub repository with instructions
for running that specific converter. Each converter has slightly different options related to the
specific pipeline being converted.

In general, the process of converting your data to Limelight XML would work like the following:

    * Run your pipeline and generate your results.

    * If not already installed, download the converter program from one of the above repositories.

    * Follow the directions for running the converter. Generally each converter will
      require that you specify the following by passing it command line parameters when you
      run the program:

        * The data file(s) generated by the search pipeline
        * The configuration file used to run the search
        * The FASTA file containing the sequences searched

    * Now the resulting Limelight XML may be uploaded to Limelight.
