HTML:

    Plotly accepts what looks like HTML in a number of places for labels.
    That text is converted to SVG by Plotly and only a small subset of HTML tags
    are recognized and converted to equivalent SVG tags, like <b> <br>.
    The tags '<script>' and '<style>' are NOT recognized so these strings passed to Plotly
    are NOT a source of script injection for XSS attacks.

    If the text is HTML escaped, the resulting SVG properly renders in the browser as the %lt; and &gt; are rendered as their characters.
    The escaped HTML has also been tested in Inkscape, a vector based program.
    The escaped HTML may not work properly in other programs but it is probably pretty easy to search and replace the offending characters.

    Limelight does NOT HTML escape strings passed to Plotly
