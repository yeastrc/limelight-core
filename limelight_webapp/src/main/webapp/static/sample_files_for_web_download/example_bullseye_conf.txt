# Bullseye parameter file
# Built by Michael Riffle <mriffle@uw.edu> November 2022
#
# This parameter file is specific to the Limelight feature detection pipeline
#
# This file specifies the parameters that will be passed to Bullseye after Hardklor is run
#
# To specify a parameter:
#	1. Uncomment it by deleting the # at the beginning of the line
#	2. Change the default value to the desired value


#            Ignore peptides that persist for this length in time.
#            These peptides are considered contaminants.
#            The unit of time is whatever unit is used in your data file.
#            Default value: 2
#c=2

#            Gap size tolerance when checking for peptides across consecutive
#            scans.
#            Default value: 1
#g=1

#            Only consider peptides below this maximum mass in daltons.
#            Default value: 8000
#m=8000

#            Only consider peptides above this minimum mass in daltons.
#            Default value: 600


#            Sets the tolerance (+/- ppm) for finding persistent peptides.
#            Default value: 5
#r=5

#            Number of consecutive scans over which a peptide must be
#            observed to be considered real. Gaps in persistence are allowed
#            when setting the -g flag.
#            Default value: 3
#s=3

#            Sets the tolerance (+/- minutes) around the retention
#            time over which a peptide can be matched to the MS/MS
#            spectrum.
#            Default value: 0.5
#t=0.5

#            Use exact match to precursor ion. Rather than use wide
#            precursor boundaries, this flag forces Bullseye to match
#            precursors to the base isotope peak identified in Hardklor.
#            The tolerance is set with the -p flag.
#            Change to true to enable
#e=false

#            Sets the tolerance (+/- ppm) for exact match searches.
#            Default value: 10
#p=10
