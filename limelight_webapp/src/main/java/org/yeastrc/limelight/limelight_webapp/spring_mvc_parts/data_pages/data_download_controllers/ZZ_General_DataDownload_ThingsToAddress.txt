For all Data Download Items:


**  The <form> contents gets form encoded before being sent to the server.

	**  JSON when form encoded is many multiple times larger as each { , "  gets encoded.
	
			For anything with lots of repeating entries like Reported Peptide Ids and PSM Ids
			use letters as delimiters/separators and put the resulting string into the JSON.
			(Do NOT use letters that would be in the encoded to base 30 or whatever base used.
			  Use letters starting backwards from 'Z' and capital letters and adjust the encoded base as needed)
			
			See PSM Download for this and other ideas like
			 
			**  Reported Peptide Id sent is difference from previous Reported Peptide Id (Sort on Reported Peptide Id first)
			 
			**  having the minimum PSM ID sent in the request for the search sent at search level 
					and then the first PSM Id under each Reported Peptide Id is difference from that minimum PSM ID
					
		    **   For each group of PSM Id under a Reported Peptide Id
		    
		    			After the first PSM Id, each PSM Id sent is difference from previous PSM Id
		    			
		    			
			**   Reported Peptide Id and PSM Id sent send as base 30 to make each entry in request shorter.
					
					Since already encoding with letter separators this does not introduce the of overhead of added " quote surrounding each value
