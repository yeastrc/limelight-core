Configuration File:

    run the program with --help-configuration-file for more information

A configuration file may be specified as a parameter 
(or included in a script used to run the executable)
or embedded in the executable jar file.

    If a script is provided to run this program,
    it may pass '-c' (or '--config=') with a value.
    Try running the script without 
    --limelight-web-app-url= 
    first and see if it is successful.
