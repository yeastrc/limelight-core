When/If start deleting records from db tables common across searches.

---

Before start, get max value of 'id'.
Never delete any records with 'id' >= max value to ensure not delete any newly inserted records.
This does NOT totally fix deleting records an import in progress just queried and will depend on but it is an extra safety step.
